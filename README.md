# watchtower

> Make "The Tower" a *true* idle game.

## Notes

- Don't mess around while watchtower is running. Take the hands off the mouse and leave.
- It's recommended to turn off the background (i.e., use no skin) to improve OCR performance.
- Only the top for upgrade boxes are supported and it is assumed that you've scrolled all the way to the top.
- Currently only number symbols up to `D` are supported (not `aa`, `ab`, ... that follow).
